                    Hi, I’m Jhaydee Besario. Nice to meet you!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I’m a UX/UI designer with a background in fashion design. As a designer, having an impact towards the end-user motivates me to continue creating a product that enhances daily activities. 

                    My past experience with fashion design, combined with my technical skills, allowed me to further understand end-user thinking by using empathy, user research, and creative design. 

                    By acquiring design and technical skills, I am able to create an effective experience for users across multiple platforms.
